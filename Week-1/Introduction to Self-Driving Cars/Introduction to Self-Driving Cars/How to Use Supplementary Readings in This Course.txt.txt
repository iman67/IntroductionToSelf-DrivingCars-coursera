Optional Readings
Please note that these Readings are optional and are not required to complete the graded assignments or  the course. 

Paywalls
While many of the articles in our Supplementary Readings are freely available, you may also experience a 'paywall' for some of the scientific journals and research articles. You are not required to purchase these articles in order to complete the graded assignments or the course.

If you cannot purchase these articles, we recommend that you visit your local university library or city library. Typically, the university Internet and library services can provide these scientific articles to you without the need to pay. Ask your local librarian for more information.
